<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
	I'm friendly, honest and reliable. I'm able to work with others and
respond creatively to problems. I pick up and understand new
ideas quickly and am able to put them in to practise immediately.
I have a keen interest in all aspects of software development.
I have experience in a wide range of languages, libraries and
platforms. Most recently I've been working on ReactJS, GraphQL and
BackboneJS applications backed by Ruby on Rails
backends hosted via Heroku, Amazon AWS and Google Cloud.
</p>
<p>
I've worked in a team of up to 5 people with code reviews, tests
and continous integration and down to a team of one with careful
changes and 'git push' deployment. I've done system
administration work, migrating systems and consolidating servers
between cloud service providers(GCE, AWS, Heroku, Route66),
and customer support investigating and providing
explainations, producing documentation and
deploying bugfixes in a timely manner in response to customer requests.

<h3>Developer at BugHerd (April 2014 - September 2021)</h3>
<p>Ruby on Rails(3.2-5.2), Javascript (React, Antd, Backbonejs, Redux, GraphQL(Apollo), SQL(Postgresql))</p>
<p>
	I worked as a critical part of a team developing a variety of new versions of the product 
	built on Reactjs with a Ruby On Rails backend. I was also heavily involved in the React/Backbone frontends and various solutions to the data layer issues that came up in an early large React application.
</p>
<p>
	I worked as the only developer/ops/support for 18 months (2016-2018) during a time of 
	low growth. This involved consolidating infrastructure, minor feature development, responding to service problems, bugfixes and customer support.
</p>
<p> 
	From 2018, the team grew again and we started major feature development again. 
	I continued as a critical team member, provided mentoring to junior developers and spearheaded the process of migrating legacy parts of the application from BackboneJS to React, Typescript and GraphQL/Apollo.
