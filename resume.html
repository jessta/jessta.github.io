    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm friendly, honest and reliable. I'm able to work with others and
      respond creatively to problems. I pick up and understand new ideas quickly
      and am able to put them in to practise immediately. I have a keen interest
      in all aspects of software development. I have experience in a wide range
      of languages, libraries and platforms. Most recently I've been working on
      ReactJS and Typescript applications backed by nodejs backends hosted via Google Cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've worked in a team of up to 10 people with code reviews, tests and
      continous integration and down to a team of one.

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h3>Senior Developer at GoodHuman (April 2024 - Current)</h3>
    <p>Typescript, NodeJS, React, Postgresql</p>

    <h3>Senior Developer at Rosemary Health (March 2022 - June 2022)</h3>
    <p>Python (flask, sqlalchemy), AWS Lambda, Postgresql</p>
    <p>
      My work at Rosemary Health required me to get up to speed with a fast
      growing team and a codebase with a slow and complex development, build and
      deploy setup.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was involved in working to simplify the build and development
      environments to allow the team to scale up.

    <h3>Senior Developer at BugHerd (April 2014 - September 2021)</h3>
    <p>

      GraphQL(Apollo), SQL(Postgresql))
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked as a critical part of a team developing a variety of new versions
      of the product built on Reactjs with a Ruby On Rails backend.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked as the only developer/ops/support for 18 months (2016-2018)
      during a time of low growth. This involved migrating/consolidating infrastructure,
			feature development, responding to service problems, bugfixes and
      customer support.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 2018, the team grew again and we started major feature development
      again. I continued as a critical team member, provided mentoring to junior
      developers and spearheaded the process of migrating legacy parts of the
      application from BackboneJS to React, Typescript and GraphQL/Apollo.
